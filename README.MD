# MotionLinx-Ai Node-RED module

MotionLinx-Ai is an EtherCat two zone high speed controller. MotionLinx-Ai is a TradeMark and 
manufactured by PULSEROLLER. This package has no relationship to the company manufacturing
the controllers. This package is our attempt to make it easier to start using 
these controllers if you have a Raspberry Pi 4 at hand.

**NOTE** MotionLinx module works on Linux OS only with EtherCAT master installed.

Follow the [instruction](https://bitbucket.org/alex-OC/workspace/snippets/gBrxbb) to install
EtherCAT master.
